${~~~~~~~~}$①Thinner isn’t always better. ②A number of studies have $\underline{~~~~1~~~~}$ that normal-weight people are in fact at higher risk of some diseases compared to those who are overweight. ③And there are health conditions for which being overweight is actually $\underline{~~~~2~~~~}$. ④ For example, heavier women are less likely to develop calcium deficiency than thin women. ⑤$\underline{~~~~3~~~~}$, among the elderly, being somewhat overweight is often an $\underline{~~~~4~~~~}$ of good health.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Of even greater $\underline{~~~~5~~~~}$ is the fact that obesity turns out to be very difficult to define. ②It is often defined $\underline{~~~~6~~~~}$ body mass index, or BMI. ③BMI $\underline{~~~~7~~~~}$ body mass divided by the square of height. ④An adult with a BMI of 18 to 25 is often considered to be normal weight. ⑤Between 25 and 30 is overweight. ⑥And over 30 is considered obese. ⑦Obesity, $\underline{~~~~8~~~~}$, can be divided into moderately obese, severely obese, and very severely obese.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①While such numerical standards seem $\underline{~~~~9~~~~}$, they are not. ②Obesity is probably less a matter of weight than body fat. ③Some people with a high BMI are in fact extremely fit, $\underline{~~~~10~~~~}$ others with a low BMI may be in poor $\underline{~~~~11~~~~}$. ④For example, many collegiate and professional football players $\underline{~~~~12~~~~}$ as obese, though their percentage body fat is low. ⑤Conversely, someone with a small frame may have high body fat but a $\underline{~~~~13~~~~}$ BMI.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Today we have a(n) $\underline{~~~~14~~~~}$ to label obesity as a disgrace. ②The overweight are sometimes $\underline{~~~~15~~~~}$ in the media with their faces covered. ③Stereotypes $\underline{~~~~16~~~~}$ with obesity include laziness, lack of will power, and lower prospects for success. ④Teachers, employers, and health professionals have been shown to harbor biases against the obese. ⑤$\underline{~~~~17~~~~}$ very young children tend to look down on the overweight, and teasing about body build has long been a problem in schools.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Negative attitudes toward obesity, $\underline{~~~~18~~~~}$ in health concerns, have stimulated a number of anti-obesity $\underline{~~~~19~~~~}$. ②My own hospital system has banned sugary drinks from its facilities. ③Many employers have instituted weight loss and fitness initiatives. ④Michelle Obama has launched a high-visibility campaign $\underline{~~~~20~~~~}$ childhood obesity, even claiming that it represents our greatest national security threat.

## Section II  Reading Comprehension (80 Points)
### Part A (40 Points)
#### Text 1
${~~~~~~~~}$①Against a backdrop of drastic changes in economy and population structure, younger Americans are drawing a new 21st-century road map to success, a latest poll has found.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Across generational lines, Americans continue to prize many of the same traditional milestones of a successful life, including getting married, having children, owning a home, and retiring in their sixties. ②But while young and old mostly agree on what constitutes the finish line of a fulfilling life, they offer strikingly different paths for reaching it.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Young people who are still getting started in life were more likely than older adults to prioritize personal fulfillment in their work, to believe they will advance their careers most by regularly changing jobs, to favor communities with more public services and a faster pace of life, to agree that couples should be financially secure before getting married or having children, and to maintain that children are best served by two parents working outside the home, the survey found.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①From career to community and family, these contrasts suggest that in the aftermath of the searing Great Recession, those just starting out in life are defining priorities and expectations that will increasingly spread through virtually all aspects of American life, from consumer preferences to housing patterns to politics.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Young and old converge on one key point: Overwhelming majorities of both groups said they believe it is harder for young people today to get started in life than it was for earlier generations. ②While younger people are somewhat more optimistic than their elders about the prospects for those starting out today, big majorities in both groups believe those “just getting started in life” face a tougher climb than earlier generations in reaching such signpost achievements as securing a good-paying job, starting a family, managing debt, and finding affordable housing.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Pete Schneider considers the climb tougher today. ②Schneider, a 27-year-old auto technician from the Chicago suburbs, says he struggled to find a job after graduating from college. ③Even now that he is working steadily, he said, “I can’t afford to pay my monthly mortgage payments on my own, so I have to rent rooms out to people to make that happen.” ④Looking back, he is struck that his parents could provide a comfortable life for their children even though neither had completed college when he was young. ⑤“I still grew up in an upper middle-class home with parents who didn’t have college degrees,” Schneider said. “I don’t think people are capable of that anymore.”

#### Text 2
${~~~~~~~~}$①“There is one and only one social responsibility of business,” wrote Milton Friedman, a Nobel prize-winning economist, “That is, to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits.” ②But even if you accept Friedman’s premise and regard corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders’ money, things may not be absolutely clear-cut. ③New research suggests that CSR may create monetary value for companies—at least when they are prosecuted for corruption.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①The largest firms in America and Britain together spend more than $15 billion a year on CSR, according to an estimate by EPG, a consulting firm. ②This could add value to their businesses in three ways. ③First, consumers may take CSR spending as a “signal” that a company’s products are of high quality. ④Second, customers may be willing to buy a company’s products as an indirect way to donate to the good causes it helps. ⑤And third, through a more diffuse “halo effect,” whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from consumers and others.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Previous studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these effects because consumers can be affected by all three. ②A recent study attempts to separate them by looking at bribery prosecutions under America’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). ③It argues that since prosecutors do not consume a company’s products as part of their investigations, they could be influenced only by the halo effect.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensive CSR programmes tended to get more lenient penalties. ②Their analysis ruled out the possibility that it was firms’ political influence, rather than their CSR stand, that accounted for the leniency: Companies that contributed more to political campaigns did not receive lower fines.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on its merits, they do seem to be influenced by a company’s record in CSR. ②“We estimate that either eliminating a substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or increasing corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% lower than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials,” says one researcher.  
${~~~~~~~~}$①Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses ought to spend on CSR. ②Nor does it reveal how much companies are banking on the halo effect, rather than the other possible benefits, when they decide their do-gooding policies. ③But at least they have demonstrated that when companies get into trouble with the law, evidence of good character can win them a less costly punishment.  

| 26  | The author views Milton Friedman's statement about CSR with $\underline{~~~~~~~~}$. |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     | A. uncertainty.                                                                     |
|     | B. skepticism.                                                                      |
|     | C. approval.                                                                        |
|     | D. tolerance.                                                                       |

|     | D. raising the quality of its products.                                  |

|     | D. less severe.                                                                          |

### Part B (20 Points)
**Translation**

1.      One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on.

2.      The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied.

3.      Thus, the anthropological concept of "culture", like the concept of "set" in mathematics, is an abstract concept which makes possible immense amounts of concrete research and understanding.

4.      Social science is that branch of intellectual enquiry which seeks to study humans and their endeavors in the same reasoned, orderly, systematic, and dispassioned manner that natural scientists use for the study of natural phenomena.

5.      Furthermore, humans have the ability to modify the environment in which they live,thus subjecting all other life forms to their own peculiar ideas and fancies.

### Part C (20 Points)
**Translation**

${~~~~~~~~}$Are the good things in life scarce? There would be competition for good jobs. Housing, at least of the better sort, would be expensive and in short supply.  
${~~~~~~~~}$Philosophically, some people questioned the meaning of "good things". They claimed, the best things in life—that is, our experiences of the world—aren't limited. At any rate, they aren't of the zero-sum variety, where the desired entity is conceived as a pie. In that metaphor, a bigger slice for one person means a smaller slice for another, or perhaps no slice at all. By contrast, think of the experiences we have in the presence of a beautiful sunset, a wonderful musician, and a great work of art. Does my appreciating these things diminish them for you? Pointedly, knowledge, values, relationships, and experiences are not the same as material possessions.
